            Hi! My name is Misha Chokshi. I am a first year CS major from Dallas, TX! Since seventh grade, I have been working for an non-profit calle Sankara Eye Foundation. The goal of this organization is to eradicate curable blindness in India. I have helped organize events and create marketing material that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars being raised and tens of thousands of eye surgeries being performed.
